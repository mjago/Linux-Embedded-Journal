Introduction
------------

The `Yocto Project <https://yoctoproject.org>`_ is an open-source
project that helps developers create custom Linux-based systems
regardless of the hardware architecture. It provides a flexible set of
tools and a space where embedded developers can share technologies,
software stacks, configs, and best practices that are used to create tailored Linux images for embedded and IOT devices.
