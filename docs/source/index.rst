Welcome to my Embedded Linux Study Journal
==========================================

I intend to record the various aspects of Embedded Linux as and when I learn
them. This includes the generation of a project written and built in Embedded
Linux - prototyped on a headless host system. If this information helps others
then all the better!

.. note:: I have lots of experience in both Embedded Programming (mostly
on *bare-metal* controllers - mostly flavours of ARM (M4, A0 etc) and Microchip
PIC's of various sizes. In addition I have been using Desktop Linux for over 10
years. This may mean the information provided suits somebody with similar prior
knowledge.

As of 22nd November 2021 this project is under active development.
