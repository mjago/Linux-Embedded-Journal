Welcome to my Embedded Linux Study Journal
==========================================

I intend to record the various aspects of **Embedded Linux** as and when I learn
them. This includes the generation of a project written and built in Embedded
Linux - prototyped on a headless host system. If this information helps others
then all the better!

**Disclaimer:** I have lots of experience in both Embedded Programming (mostly
on *bare-metal* controllers using *ARM* devices and *Microchip
PIC's* of various sizes. In addition I have been using Desktop Linux for over 10
years. This may mean the information provided suits somebody with similar prior
knowledge.

This Journal is under active development.
